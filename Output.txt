Testing the to fahrenheit method. Expects 50 for celsius and 82 for fahrenheit.
Temperature in celsius is: 50.0
Actual: 
Temperature in fahrenheit is: 82.0

Testing the toString method. Expects fahrenheit for patient1 temperature unit
patient1: HealthMonitor:[Blood pressure: 126/97mmHG Condition: Blood pressure is TOO HIGH!!!!
Temperature: 82.0Fahrenheit Condition: Temperature is too high
Heart Beat Rate: 100/minute Condition: !!!On the  High edge!!!]

Testing the equals method. Expected: true 
Actual: true
Equals '==' method will return false and
the'.equals()' overriden method will return true.' 
== : false
.equals() :  true
the two are not equal. false is expected: false
Change the bottom value of one of the equal objects.
false is expected. 
Actual: false

This method [getAllMinimumAndMaximum()] will return all 
the minimum and maximum values for the 
Blodd pressure, Temperature, and Heart beat.
Testing......[Blood pressure maximum: 140/90
Blood pressure minimum: 120/80
Temperature maximum: 37.2
Temperature mimimum: 36.1
Heart beat rate maximum: 100
Heart beat rate minimum: 60]
